# Processing-fountain
Simple first Processing project (I'm on break and I'm really bored lol). Run this script in the Processing IDE. Click anywhere in the graphical window to create a colorful fountain.

You can download the Processing IDE [here](https://processing.org/download). I chose to implement this project in Python rather than in Java, which is Processing's default language, mostly out of familiarity with the former language.

If you want to run everything from your Terminal:
``` git clone https://github.com/rshiv2/Processing-fountain.git```
```mv Processing-fountain Fountain```
```cd Fountain```
```open Fountain.pyde -a Processing```

... and voil√°, the Processing IDE will open up. Click the run button to view the graphical window!

## Debugging note
I messed up when naming this repo. It turns out that the name of your project directory and your .pyde file have to match. Processing won't allow me to rename the .pyde file to ```Processing-fountain.pyde```, presumably because of the hyphen. Instead, you'll have to rename the project / repo directory to ```Fountain``` and then open the sketch. Sorry about that, will avoid this issue in future projects!
